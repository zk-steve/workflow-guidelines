## Summary

### 1. Workflow

Backlog → In Progress → Testing → Done

- Backlog: 
- Todo: 
- In Progress: 
- Testing: 
- Done: 

### 2. Limit Work in Progress

Max 2 concurrent tasks per person.

### 3. Task Policies

- Backlog -> Todo:
- Todo -> In Progress:
- In Progress -> Testing:
- Testing -> Done:

### 4. Pull, Don’t Push

Team members pull tasks into their workflow.

## Guideline

### 1. Visualize the Entire Workflow

- Best Practice: Make all tasks visible to everyone on a shared Kanban board.
- Use columns to represent workflow stages (e.g., Backlog → In Progress → Testing → Done).
- Add swimlanes for different types of work (e.g., Features, Bugs, Support).
- Guideline: Keep the board simple and intuitive. Avoid over-complicating the process.

### 2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)

- Best Practice: Set WIP limits to reduce multitasking and avoid bottlenecks.
- Example: Limit “In Progress” tasks to 2 per team member or 5 for the team.
- Guideline: Regularly review and adjust WIP limits based on team capacity and workflow.

### 3. Define Clear Task Policies

- Best Practice: Establish explicit criteria for moving tasks between columns.
- For example, a task can only move to “Testing” if it has passed code review and all unit tests.
- Guideline: Document policies and ensure they’re visible on the board or shared internally.

### 4. Pull, Don’t Push

- Best Practice: Let team members pull tasks into their workflow rather than assigning them.
- This ensures ownership and avoids overloading individuals.
- Guideline: Empower team members to decide when they’re ready to take on more work.

### 5. Measure and Manage Flow

- Best Practice: Track metrics to improve efficiency:
- Cycle Time: How long it takes to complete a task.
- Lead Time: The time from task creation to completion.
- Throughput: Number of tasks completed in a specific time.
- Guideline: Use tools like cumulative flow diagrams to identify bottlenecks and optimize processes.

### 6. Prioritize Regularly

- Best Practice: Use a prioritized backlog to ensure the team is always working on the most valuable tasks.
- Guideline: Involve stakeholders in prioritization during periodic planning or backlog grooming sessions.

### 7. Foster Collaboration

- Best Practice: Encourage team members to work together on tasks, especially for high-priority or blocked tasks.
- Guideline: Use standups and Kanban boards to facilitate real-time communication and updates.

### 8. Conduct Regular Reviews and Retrospectives

- Best Practice: Hold retrospectives to reflect on what’s working and what isn’t.
- Example: Review WIP limits, process policies, or tool configurations.
- Guideline: Focus on actionable insights and continuous improvement.

### 9. Automate Repetitive Processes

- Best Practice: Use automation to reduce manual updates on the board.
- Example: Automatically move tasks to “Done” when pull requests are merged.
- Guideline: Use tools like Jira, Trello, or Azure DevOps with built-in automation capabilities.

### 10. Align with Team Goals

- Best Practice: Ensure the Kanban process supports the team’s overall objectives.
- For example, align WIP limits and workflows with sprint or quarterly goals.
- Guideline: Review alignment during retrospectives or planning sessions.

### 11. Manage Blockers Proactively

- Best Practice: Highlight blocked tasks with visual indicators (e.g., tags or colors).
- Example: Use a red card or a “Blocked” column.
- Guideline: Assign ownership of resolving blockers to avoid delays.

### 12. Start Small and Scale Gradually

- Best Practice: Begin with a simple board and workflow, then add complexity as needed.
- Guideline: Involve the team in designing the Kanban process to ensure buy-in.

### 13. Respect Team Capacity

- Best Practice: Avoid overloading the team by respecting individual and collective limits.
- Guideline: Use velocity or throughput data to plan capacity realistically.

### 14. Celebrate Wins

- Best Practice: Acknowledge completed tasks and milestones to motivate the team.
- Guideline: Use visual cues (e.g., marking the “Done” column with stars) or verbal praise during meetings.

### 15. Commit to Continuous Improvement

- Best Practice: Regularly analyze the process and implement small, incremental changes.
- Guideline: Use feedback loops like retrospectives or metrics analysis to drive improvements.
